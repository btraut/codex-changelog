# Codex Changelog Bot

A Twitter (X) bot that posts when new versions of [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) are released.

Follow [@CodexLog](https://x.com/CodexLog) to stay up to date.

## How it works

The bot checks the [OpenAI changelog](https://developers.openai.com/changelog/) every 15 minutes. When a new Codex release is detected, it posts a thread summarizing the new features, bug fixes, docs, and chores.
